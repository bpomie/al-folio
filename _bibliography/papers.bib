  abstract = {Whether young infants can exploit socio-pragmatic information to interpret new words is a matter of debate. Based on findings and theories from the action interpretation literature, we hypothesized that 12-month-olds should distinguish communicative object-directed actions expressing reference from instrumental object-directed actions indicative of one’s goals, and selectively use the former to identify referents of novel linguistic expressions. This hypothesis was tested across four eye-tracking experiments. Infants watched pairs of unfamiliar objects, one of which was first targeted by either a communicative action (e.g., pointing) or an instrumental action (e.g., grasping) and then labeled with a novel word. As predicted, infants fast-mapped the novel words onto the targeted objects after pointing (Experiments 1 and 4) but not after grasping (Experiment 2) unless the grasping action was preceded by an ostensive signal (Experiment 3). Moreover, whenever infants mapped a novel word onto the object indicated by a communicative action, they tended to map a different novel word onto the distractor object, displaying a mutual exclusivity effect. This reliance on nonverbal action interpretation in the disambiguation of novel words indicates that socio-pragmatic inferences about reference likely supplement associative and statistical learning mechanisms from the outset of word learning.}

  abstract = {Determining others’ motor competence is critical for action prediction and social decision making. One aspect of competence judgements involves assessing how costly a given action is for a particular agent (e.g., whether climbing 4 floors of stairs is a piece of cake or a tough physical exercise). Such information is not given away by the agents’ physical appearance but can be inferred based on their behavior. Across two looking-time experiments, we show that 10-month-olds can infer and compare agent-specific costs of different actions. After being familiarized with agent A jumping over low obstacles and walking around high obstacles, and agent B jumping over both low and high obstacles, infants worked out that for B jumping bears little cost, while for A jumping high is more costly than detouring the obstacles by walking. Furthermore, they used this motor competence judgements to predict both agents’ actions in a new environment. These findings suggest that basic building blocks competence evaluations are available in infancy and may be rooted in infants’ action interpretation skills.}

  abstract = {To what extent does language shape how we think about the world? Studies suggest that linguistic symbols expressing conceptual categories (‘apple’, ‘squirrel’) make us focus on categorical information (e.g. that you saw a squirrel) and disregard individual information (e.g. whether that squirrel had a long or short tail). Across two experiments with preverbal infants, we demonstrated that it is not language but nonverbal category knowledge that determines what information is packed into object representations. Twelve-month-olds (N = 48) participated in an electroencephalography (EEG) change-detection task involving objects undergoing a brief occlusion. When viewing objects from unfamiliar categories, infants detected both across- and within-category changes, as evidenced by their negative central wave (Nc) event-related potential. Conversely, when viewing objects from familiar categories, they did not respond to within-category changes, which indicates that nonverbal category knowledge interfered with the representation of individual surface features necessary to detect such changes. Furthermore, distinct patterns of γ and α oscillations between familiar and unfamiliar categories were evident before and during occlusion, suggesting that categorization had an influence on the format of recruited object representations. Thus, we show that nonverbal category knowledge has rapid and enduring effects on object representation and discuss their functional significance for generic knowledge acquisition in the absence of language.},

  abstract = {Representing objects in terms of their kinds enables inferences based on the long-term knowledge made available through kind concepts. For example, children readily use lexical knowledge linked to familiar kind concepts to
  disambiguate new words (e.g., “find the toma”): they exclude members of familiar kinds falling under familiar
  kind labels (e.g., a ball) as potential referents and link new labels to available unfamiliar objects (e.g., a funnel), a
  phenomenon dubbed as ‘mutual exclusivity’. Younger infants’ failure in mutual exclusivity tasks has been
  commonly interpreted as a limitation of early word-learning or inferential abilities. Here, we investigated an
  alternative explanation, according to which infants do not spontaneously represent familiar objects under kind
  concepts, hence lacking access to the information necessary for rejecting them as referents of novel labels.
  Building on findings about conceptual development and communication, we hypothesized that nonverbal
  communication could prompt infants to set up kind-based representations which, in turn, would promote mutual
  exclusivity inferences. This hypothesis was tested in a looking-while-listening task involving novel word
  disambiguation. Twelve-month-olds saw pairs of objects, one familiar and one unfamiliar, and heard familiar
  kind labels or novel words. Across two experiments providing a cross-lab replication in two different languages,
  infants successfully disambiguated novel words when the familiar object had been pointed at before labeling, but
  not when it had been highlighted in a non-communicative manner (Experiment 1) or not highlighted at all
  (Experiment 2). Nonverbal communication induced infants to recruit kind-based representations of familiar
  objects that they failed to recruit in its absence and that, once activated, supported mutual-exclusivity inferences.
  Developmental changes in children’s appreciation of communicative contexts may modulate the expression of
  early inferential and word learning competences.}
