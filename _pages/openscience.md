I am committed to transparent and open scientific practices. I believe it is the best way to make science reproducible and inclusive.

I share the the materials, data, and code used in my studies via my <a href="https://osf.io/zguaj/">OSF</a> and <a href = "https://github.com/bpomie">GitHub</a> repositories.
