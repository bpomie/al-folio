Thank you for stopping by to learn about my research. I use methods from <i>cognitive neuroscience, experimental psychology and psycholinguistics</i> to investigate <b>how the human mind develops and what are the building blocks of children's incredible learning abilities</b>.

One special thing about humans is that, unlike other animals, we spend lots of our time manipulating symbols, whether we talk, read books, enjoy TV shows, stroll around art galleries, use maps to get around, or think of our restaurant bills. Some of the complex combinatorial systems we put to use are difficult to learn (like maths or programming languages), others are acquired absolutely naturally during the first years of life (like natural language). My research aims to uncover <b>how we learn combinatorial symbolic systems, how they foster our intelligence and learning, and how our thinking might look like without them</b>. What kind of thoughts are entertained by babies who do not yet master language? Does symbolic combinatorial thought start with language acquisition or, perhaps, it is available before? If it is, then what form does it take? <b> Find out more about my research </b> in my <a href="publications"> publications</a> and projects portfolio (that I am currently developing).

If you would like to learn more or collaborate, please do get in touch!

<i>Short bio</i>. I am currently a postdoctoral scientist at <a href="https://cdc.ceu.edu/">CEU Cognitive Development Center</a>, where I work with Gergely Csibra. Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow with Agnes Kovacs and Erno Teglas. I completed my PhD in developmental cognitive neuroscience at <a href="http://cbcd.bbk.ac.uk/"> Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development</a> at Birkbeck, University of London under the supervision of <b><a href = ""> Teodora Gliga</a></b>. My dissertation looked at the interactions between word learning and concepts during the first year of life.
